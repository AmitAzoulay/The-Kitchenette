# The Kitchenette

Welcome to the kitchenette a tribute to the legendary "kitchen cabinet" — not the kind you install above your sink, but the one where Golda Meir and Moshe Dayan famously cooked up state secrets over coffee and kugel. Much like those unofficial strategy sessions, this app is where serious business gets discussed… with zero minutes of official meeting scheduled. It’s a chat app, yes — but also a digital shtetl where real-time messages fly faster than diplomatic cables, and every emoji could start (or end) a crisis. Welcome to the warmest war room on the web.

Built to support Kubernetes, this app brings together the best of:

    - MongoDB – because storing your chats in Post-Its just isn’t scalable

    - Express.js – handling routes like Dayan handled crises

    - React – for snappy UIs and even snappier comebacks


    - Node.js – the glue binding it all together like a late-night strategy session over too much coffee
  
And yes - it’s K8s-ready, because what’s a proper kitchen cabinet without containers?
